# Motivation

## Why Build a Raspberry Pi Cluster?

As someone who works with high-performance computing and distributed systems in a professional setting, I have always been curious about building a cluster from the ground up. Not in the cloud, but something I could run at home. This project started from that curiosity.

Cloud services like AWS, GCP, and Azure are great for running large and flexible deployments, but they also come with recurring costs. For smaller or long-term personal projects, those costs can add up quickly. I wanted something that is affordable, physically present, and fully under my control. Building a Raspberry Pi cluster seemed like the right solution.

At the same time, I was looking for something much smaller than full-sized rack servers. I wanted a setup that would not take up much space and would run quietly without consuming a lot of power. Raspberry Pi boards were a perfect match for that. They are compact, energy-efficient, and powerful enough to run real workloads when configured correctly.

This is also a way for me to show how passionate I am about my work. It helps me face the kinds of problems that often appear in real environments, especially in companies that still rely on on-premise servers. Working with this mini cluster lets me try things out in a safe space and prepare for real-world challenges that I might run into in my professional work.

## Goals of This Project

- **Learn by Doing**: Build everything from the ground up to better understand how container orchestration, networking, and distributed storage actually work in practice.
- **Cost-Effective Setup**: Create a home lab that feels close to real production systems without relying on expensive cloud services.
- **Run Things Locally**: Host my own dashboards, services, databases, and monitoring tools without depending on external platforms.
- **Work with Real Hardware**: Set things up manually and deal with actual machines, not just virtual ones. This includes wiring, powering, and configuring each Pi node from scratch.

## Inspiration

I was inspired by my experience working with clusters in a professional setting, where I often deal with large systems that run behind the scenes. I have also seen a number of people online build their own homelabs to learn, experiment, and run services for themselves. Seeing how they approached it made me realize I could try it too.

This project started out as something small, but it quickly became a space where I could explore ideas more freely. I decided to document everything here not just for myself, but in case it helps someone else who is thinking about doing the same.
