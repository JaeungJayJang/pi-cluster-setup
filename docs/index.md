# Raspberry Pi Cluster Setup Journey

Welcome to my documentation of building and configuring a Raspberry Pi cluster! This site chronicles the entire journey from planning to deployment, including all the challenges, solutions, and lessons learned along the way.

## 🔍 Why I Started This Project

As someone who works with HPC clusters and distributed systems professionally, I wanted a hands-on way to explore similar concepts at home. While cloud solutions like AWS are powerful, they’re often too costly for personal experimentation. That’s why I decided to build my own Raspberry Pi cluster from the ground up.

This project not only provided a more affordable and flexible learning platform, but—let’s be honest—it also feels pretty cool to say I have a working Raspberry Pi cluster running in my home network. Every node’s IP is pinned to avoid DHCP rotation, and everything is configured over a wired, closed network for stability.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project documents the complete process of setting up a Raspberry Pi cluster for learning distributed computing, container orchestration, and DevOps practices. Whether you're a beginner or experienced developer, you'll find detailed guides, troubleshooting tips, and real-world insights.

## 🚀 Quick Start

If you're looking to jump right in, here's what you'll need:

1. **Hardware**: 4+ Raspberry Pi 4 boards (4GB+ RAM recommended)
2. **Networking**: Gigabit switch and ethernet cables
3. **Storage**: High-quality microSD cards (64GB+ each)
4. **Power**: USB-C power supplies or PoE HATs
5. **Optional**: Case or rack for organization

## 💡 Key Learnings

Throughout this journey, I've documented:

- **Performance insights**: Real-world benchmarks and limitations
- **Cost analysis**: Total investment and cost-per-performance ratios
