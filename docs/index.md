## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're looking to jump right in, here's what you'll need:

1. **Hardware**: 4+ Raspberry Pi 4 boards (4GB+ RAM recommended)
2. **Networking**: Gigabit switch and ethernet cables
3. **Storage**: High-quality microSD cards (64GB+ each)
4. **Power**: USB-C power supplies or PoE HATs
5. **Optional**: Case or rack for organization

## üí° Key Learnings

Throughout this journey, I've documented:

- **Performance insights**: Real-world benchmarks and limitations
- **Cost analysis**: Total investment and cost-per-performance ratios
- **Best practices**: Configuration patterns that work reliably
- **Pitfalls to avoid**: Common mistakes and how to prevent them
